# DocuBot: Your Personal AI Knowledge Base

**DocuBot** is a private, local-first AI assistant designed to help developers and tech professionals instantly find information within their own codebase, notes, and personal documentation. Tired of searching through countless files to remember how you solved a problem? DocuBot provides a conversational search interface over your fragmented knowledge base.

## üí° The Core Idea

In a world of cloud-based AI, DocuBot offers a truly personal and secure solution. Instead of sending your sensitive code to a third-party API, DocuBot runs entirely on your local machine, using an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to give you answers about your own work.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **100% Private:** Your code and notes never leave your computer. All processing happens locally.
* **Conversational Search:** Ask natural language questions like, "What was that Python script I used to handle S3 uploads?"
* **Offline Access:** Works without an internet connection, ensuring you always have access to your knowledge base.
* **Lightweight & Efficient:** Built with minimal dependencies to run smoothly on any machine.
