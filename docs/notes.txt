DocuBot is a local-first AI knowledge assistant for developers. 
It allows you to ask questions about your code, notes, or documentation without sending data to the cloud.

Key features:
1. 100% private: All data is stored locally; nothing is sent to external servers.
2. Conversational search: Ask questions naturally, and DocuBot finds the most relevant information.
3. Offline access: Works completely offline after initial setup.
4. Lightweight & efficient: Minimal dependencies and fast response times.

Workflow:
1. Add files to the docs/ folder. Supported formats: .txt, .md, .py, .json, .csv.
2. Run the indexing script (`run_bot.py`) to prepare the knowledge base.
3. Ask questions in the terminal interface. Answers will be drawn from the indexed files.
4. To update knowledge, add new files or modify existing ones, then re-run the script.

Supported functionalities:
- Code explanations: Ask about functions, classes, or scripts.
- Documentation summaries: Get condensed info from markdown or text files.
- Quick reference: Search for definitions, examples, or notes.
- Conversational QA: Ask follow-up questions and DocuBot remembers context for the session.

Best practices:
- Keep files organized: Separate notes by topic for better retrieval.
- Use meaningful filenames: DocuBot indexes by file paths for traceability.
- Chunk large files: If a file is too big, consider splitting it to improve answer precision.
- Regularly update: Add new information to the docs/ folder to keep your knowledge base current.

Limitations:
- Accuracy depends on the quality of the notes provided.
- Works best with structured, clear, and concise information.
- Very large documents may slow indexing; consider breaking them into smaller chunks.
